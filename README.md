# MachineLearning-Sentinent-Analysis

The aim of this project is to accurately classify and predict text content and specifically categorize sentences with claims and evidences by its relevance to the measurable indicators of the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goal #3 (Good Health and Well-Being) using a variety of Deep Neural Network models for multiclass text classification, that have been demonstrated through the years to be capable of achieving remarkable performance in sentence and document modelling. This approach we believe that will help governments to take better decisions and make more accurate actions concerning the elimination of the specific problem, which has plagued for many years millions of people. We will consider three network models: the first one is a Feed Forward Neural Network (MLP), the second is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the third one is a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). We will take into account several open access records and scientific articles collections / documents from PubMed and we will investigate on the behavior of the neural networks by defining which model give us the best results and subsequently evaluate the predictions of the best model using the PubMed scientific articles collection as test case.
